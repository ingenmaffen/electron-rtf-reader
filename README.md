# electron-rtf-reader

## The purpose of this app
I got a really long .rtf file and I did not want to read it in a text editor, so I made this.
One of my friend asked me why didn't I just converted it to .pdf
I replied: That would be too easy. Where is the fun in that?
##  Usage
Run
```
npm install
```
and
```
npm start
